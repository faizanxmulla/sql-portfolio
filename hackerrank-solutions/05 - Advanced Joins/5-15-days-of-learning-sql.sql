-- Write a query to print total number of unique hackers who made at least  submission each day (starting on the first day of the contest), and find the hacker_id and name of the hacker who made maximum number of submissions each day. 

-- If more than one such hacker has a maximum number of submissions, print the lowest hacker_id. The query should print this information for each day of the contest, sorted by the date.
