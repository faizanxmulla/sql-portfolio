## Case Study Questions - Segment Analysis


1. Using our filtered dataset by removing the interests with less than 6 months worth of data, which are the top 10 and bottom 10 interests which have the largest composition values in any month_year? Only use the maximum composition value for each interest but you must keep the corresponding month_year

2. Which 5 interests had the lowest average ranking value?

3. Which 5 interests had the largest standard deviation in their percentile_ranking value?

4. For the 5 interests found in the previous question - what was minimum and maximum percentile_ranking values for each interest and its corresponding year_month value? Can you describe what is happening for these 5 interests?

5. How would you describe our customers in this segment based off their composition and ranking values? What sort of products or services should we show to these customers and what should we avoid?

## Solutions:

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [DB Fiddle]().
